Why is...

Why is incest wrong?

It's, uh- It's not clear to me that it's wrong.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.700 line:80% align:center
Okay.

Listen- Listen to me, l-l-listen to me.

If, a brother and a sister love each other and use contraception,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.700 line:95% align:center
is- is there something absolutely morally wrong about that, I'm, I-

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.000 line:95% align:center
A-and that by the way, and it was once,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000 line:95% align:center
and they went off and it didn't affect anything else,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.450 line:95% align:center
I have to think about it, because I don't think there's any absolute condemnation

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.150 line:95% align:center
of that fact if they love each other and care for each other,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.250 line:95% align:center
and they go off and it doesn't affect anything else, I, I-

Okay.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.450 line:95% align:center
Would I recommend it? No!

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.550 line:95% align:center
What I'll be practically happy about whether will I be willing

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.950 line:95% align:center
to listen to those arguments, if they were rational, maybe.
