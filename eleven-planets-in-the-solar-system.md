## Allegation
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>12:4</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">إِذْ قَالَ يُوسُفُ لِأَبِيهِ يَٰٓأَبَتِ إِنِّى رَأَيْتُ <mark>أَحَدَ عَشَرَ كَوْكَبًا</mark> وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ لِى سَٰجِدِينَ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">When Joseph said unto his father: O my father! Lo! I saw in a dream <mark>eleven planets</mark> and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating themselves unto me.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

This implies the existence of "eleven planets" in our solar system.

## Refutation
Seeing eleven planets in a dream doesn't mean there are eleven planets in our solar system. If an individual sees five suns in his dream, does this mean he's claiming there to be five suns in our solar system? Of course not.

The critic has lost all sense of logic here; the Quran simply relays Joseph telling his father about his dream, and nobody is making the scientific claim of the existence of eleven planets in our solar system.

If the critic took the time to read **Surah Yūsuf** fully, he'll realize how completely unreasonable his claim was:

### **<strong>12:100</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيْهِ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ وَ<mark>خَرُّوا۟ لَهُۥ سُجَّدًا</mark> ۖ وَقَالَ يَٰٓأَبَتِ <mark>هَٰذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُءْيَٰىَ مِن قَبْلُ</mark> قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّى حَقًّا ۖ وَقَدْ أَحْسَنَ بِىٓ إِذْ أَخْرَجَنِى مِنَ ٱلسِّجْنِ وَجَآءَ بِكُم مِّنَ ٱلْبَدْوِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ أَن نَّزَغَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ إِخْوَتِىٓ ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَطِيفٌ لِّمَا يَشَآءُ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And he placed his parents on the dais and <mark>they fell down before him prostrate</mark>, and he said: O my father! <mark>This is the interpretation of my dream of old</mark>. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren. Verily my Lord is tender unto whom He will. He is the Knower, the Wise.</p>

When we read this verse carefully, we'll conclude that the meaning of his past dream was that the eleven planets he saw were his eleven brothers, the moon and the sun were his parents, and their prostration refers to the one at this event.

Even if the critic persists in coping through his broken logic, I'd like to point out that seven planets isn't a fixed number, and that it changes depending on what scientists determine. Here, I'll present to him a children's book that conforms with his little understanding:

### **<strong>11 Planets: A New View of the Solar System</strong>**
<p style="text-align:center;">In August 2006, the International Astronomical Union redefined the word "planet" and relegated Pluto to the status of a dwarf planet, along with Ceres and Eris. Naturally, National Geographic is there to map out this new view of our solar system. In 11 Planets, David Aguilar, an expert who works on the leading edge of this astounding shift, explains and explores our new galactic knowledge. Using spectacular computer artwork, exclusive to National Geographic, and simple engaging text, this colorful book profiles all 11 planets in our newly categorized solar system: terrestrial <markpink>Mercury</markpink>, <markpink>Venus</markpink>, <markpink>Earth</markpink>, and <markpink>Mars</markpink>; gas giants <markgreen>Jupiter</markgreen>, <markgreen>Saturn</markgreen>, <markgreen>Uranus</markgreen>, and <markgreen>Neptune</markgreen>; and dwarf planets <markblue>Pluto</markblue>, <markblue>Ceres</markblue>, and <markblue>Eris</markblue>.</p>

David Aguilar's National Geographic book of points out that even if our sun has hundreds of orbiting planets, it still doesn't take away that scientists have determined that our solar system consists of eleven main planets that can be classified into terrestrial planets, gas giants, and dwarfs. Those planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune; Pluto, Ceres, Eris; our moon, and the sun.
