Refutation of the irrational and illogical nonsense of atheism has been undergoing all shapes and colors; using academic papers and articles to refute atheism, trying to prove Allah (ﷻ)'s existence and divinity, and clarifying that Islam is the only correct way of life accepted by Allah (ﷻ). Here, we do something else.

We all know how atheists brag about being the "enlightened" people in the fields of scientific development, claiming that they love science and that religion is the only thing that leaves us behind and prevents us from advancing in this field, but today we'll disprove atheism using the very thing they claim to love the most; mathematics.

Mathematics is the foundation of all science; it was the earliest developed field of science, and without it we wouldn't understand how science works. Disproving atheism using math is an uncommon method and an unusual approach, but it helps greatly to clarify how absurd atheism is when it'll be made known to them that this belief is totally contradictory to what they hold sacred.

Since atheism is the concept of rejection of Allah (ﷻ)'s existence, it implies two very strange things:
1. Rejection of the concept of infiniteness.
2. Misinterpretation of the concept of negation.

Infinity and 0 are two very important concepts in mathematics, there is no shade of doubt about this, so to reject one and to misunderstand the other is not very helpful in developing mathematics as a field of science, as these two concepts are pretty fundamental. If atheists claim that there is no Allah (ﷻ), they would have to reject the concept of infinity, for we, as Muslims, believe that Allah (ﷻ) is limitless in all of His attributes, and our inability to comprehend His infinite nature is due to our finite nature, since the finite can't hold enough knowledge of the infinite:

### **<strong>112:4</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌۢ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Nor is there to Him any equivalent.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

With that being said, we'll now move on to tell you that atheists reject the concept of infinity, since the main reason why they reject Allah (ﷻ)'s existence is because they cannot comprehend it, thus simply rejecting it. We could say that if an atheist tells you that the set of real numbers goes from negative infinity to positive infinity, he would be lying. If a person rejects Allah (ﷻ)'s existence because he is unable to understand Allah (ﷻ)'s infinite nature, then he would have to reject the fact that numbers have no end. But the catch here is that if we put a limit to numbers, then this would destroy everything mathematics is built upon; every concept, every universally agreed-upon fact and statement, every piece of induction and elsewhat.

Atheism is, basically:
> "I cannot comprehend infinity, therefore I will reject it. Numbers have an end."

Another issue with atheism is that it implies that 0=1; atheists believe that nothing produced everything, which does not make sense, because for everything to exist there has to be a cause. For the universe, Allah (ﷻ) is the Creator and the ultimate cause of everything, He is the All-Powerful, the Eternal Being; trying to understand Allah (ﷻ)'s Being would be the same as trying to count from negative infinity up to positive infinity, which is of course impossible, as we, as human beings, are simple creatures, restricted by our finite abilities.

In mathematics, the only way for A to be equal to B is if B is just another way of expressing A, or vice versa. But if we have assigned different values to each of these, then a=b is a false statement, and the only way through which we have reached this point is by dividing by 0. As we can see here, atheism allows division by 0, therefore breaking another math law.

Division by 0 does not exist, neither does its limit, and since atheism is based on the belief that everything appeared from nothing, this implies that 0 kept multiplying itself some amount of times until it eventually became 1.

Let's say, hypothetically, that this amount of repetition is infinity; here, atheism fails us again, since 0 times infinity is undefined, and its limit is 0. 0 times infinity could theoratically give you 1 if you use the limit of 1/X as X approaches infinity, but atheism rejects the whole concept of infinity, remember?

Now, we do not only have irrational and false statements, we also have contradicting
theories and beliefs; atheism claims it empowers science, while in reality it does exactly the opposite, as we could see in the previous paragraphs, atheism rejects the fundamental concepts of mathematics.

As a conclusion:
* Atheism rejects the concept of infinity.
* Atheism offers a false interpretation of numbers, especially 0.
* Atheism allows division by 0.

Yet, people still take atheists seriously, even though they're literally math-type flat-earthers.
