## Allegation
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>7:148</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَٱتَّخَذَ قَوْمُ مُوسَىٰ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ مِنْ حُلِيِّهِمْ <mark>عِجْلًا جَسَدًا لَّهُۥ خُوَارٌ</mark> ۚ أَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّهُۥ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ وَلَا يَهْدِيهِمْ سَبِيلًا ۘ ٱتَّخَذُوهُ وَكَانُوا۟ ظَٰلِمِينَ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And the folk of Moses made, after (he left them), out of their ornaments, <mark>a calf (for worship), which gave a lowing sound</mark>. Saw they not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way? They chose it, and became wrongdoers.</p>

### **<strong>20:88-89</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">فَأَخْرَجَ لَهُمْ <mark>عِجْلًا جَسَدًا لَّهُۥ خُوَارٌ</mark> فَقَالُوا۟ هَٰذَآ إِلَٰهُكُمْ وَإِلَٰهُ مُوسَىٰ فَنَسِىَ ۝ أَفَلَا يَرَوْنَ أَلَّا يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلًا وَلَا يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">So he brought forth for them <mark>a calf, a (mere) body, which had a lowing sound</mark>, so they said: "This is your god and the god of Musa, but he forgot." Could they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good?</p>

The Quran here describes a statue of a calf that was capable of "mooing."

## Refutation
Again, mockery and ridicule of supernatural occurrences, but little did the critic know that this isn't supernatural at all.

In both verses, the root of "khuwar (خوار)," meaning "a lowing sound," is derived from the root "Kh-W-R (خ-و-ر)," and it means low, bellow, an uttering of a cry, becoming weak, feeble, languid, soft, fragile, faint, remit, abate, etc. The sound produced by the mooing statue falls into this category. Cows communicate with moos, but both **7:148** and **20:88-89** explicitly state that the image of a calf cannot speak, but instead, it had a "lowing sound," or a "mooing sound."

In **7:148**, "yukallim (يكلم)," meaning "(to) speak," is derived from the root "K-L-M (ك-ل-م)," and it means a wound or an opening of the skin. It is also used to mean words or statements since those are the products of the opening of the mouth, which is an opening of the skin. Therefore, the verse implicitly states that the lowing sound is not produced by opening the mouth, which is how cows moo.

The perfect explanation for this is that anyone can build a statue which produces sound; if we take precise measurments to allow wind pass by the statue, that leaves a certain sound, similar to how blowing into pipe produces sound:

### **<strong>Tafsir ibn Kathir (20:89)</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">قال ابن عباس: لا والله ما كان خواره إلا أن <mark>يدخل الريح في دبره فيخرج من فيه</mark>، فيسمع له صوت.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Ibn Abbas said:</b> Nay, by Allah, the moaning sound of the calf was nothing but <mark>wind that would enter into its behind and come out of its mouth</mark>, thus causing it to make a sound.</p>

This is a total scientific failure, coming from the one who tries desperately to disprove the Quran for all the time he goes on about science.
