## Allegation

### **<strong>13:3</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى مَدَّ ٱلْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَٰسِىَ وَأَنْهَٰرًا ۖ وَ<mark>مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ جَعَلَ فِيهَا زَوْجَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ</mark> ۖ يُغْشِى ٱلَّيْلَ ٱلنَّهَارَ ۚ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and flowing streams, and <mark>of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and female)</mark>. He covereth the night with the day. Herein verily are portents for people who take thought.</p>

Without the slightest doubt, that is plain nonsense. There are no male and female apples, male and female strawberries, etc. Fruits do not have a gender; fruits do neither have intercourse nor do fruits give birth. They do not impregnate or fertilize each other. No matter how many pieces of fruit you put together in the same basket, and no matter how long you wait, they will not multiply. They will not give birth to little fruit children. With time, they will only spoil and get rotten. In its literal understanding, this statement of the Quran is not a scientific miracle, it's a total scientific failure.

## Refutation
A pair of shoes doesn't mean that one is male and the other is female, and if one is constantly thinking about it in this day and age, it means that he has a really sick mentality.

I'll assume that they quoted Pickthall's personal commentary in his translation, but the main fact is that it's not explicitly mentioned in the verse that one is male and another is female in the original Arabic text, however, critics don't care, they interpret the aforementioned verse as if there are male and female fruits, choosing the inaccurate commentary to best suit their needs. This, as we know, does not occur in nature, but the critics just like to twist the facts and interpreted the verse in the sense of their degenerate fantasies and sexual fetishes.

In that verse, Allah (ﷻ) informs us that the theme in nature is that He creates in pairs and opposites, such as; male and female in humans, animals, plants, etc. He also created inanimate entities in pairs and opposites, such as; protons and electrons.

In the context of the above verse the Arabic word "zawjain (زوجين)" should not be used to imply there are male and female fruits but rather fruits occur in pairs and opposites. A pair is similar opposite, and for every type of fruit, there exists a similar opposite. As examples, we mention:
* Dry and fleshy fruits.
* Aggregate and multiple fruits.
* Seedless fruits and fruits with seeds.
* Ripe and unripe fruits.

A fruit by definition is a reproductive structure of an angiosperm (flowering plant) that develops from the ovary and accessory tissue, which surrounds and protects the seed. Fruits are important in seed dispersal.

Fruit is the end product of reproduction of the superior plants. The stage preceding fruit is the flower, which has male and female organs; stamens and ovules. Once pollen has been carried to the flower, they bear fruit, which in turn matures and frees its seed. All fruits therefore imply the existence of male and female organs.

We could divide fruit into two groups. Those groups can be considered to be opposites of each other; fertilized fruits and pathenocarpic (non-fertilized) fruits. The differentiating factor is based on whether the fruit develops from fertilization or not. Fertilized fruit develop from fertilization and have seeds while pathenocarpic fruit do not develop from fertilization and have no seeds. An example of a fertilized fruit is a mango, while bananas and figs are examples of pathenocarpic fruits. While the majority of fruits are fertilized fruits, the understanding of fruits being created in pairs is best explained in this manner.

There are no "scientific errors."
