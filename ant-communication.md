### **<strong>27:18-19</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَتَوْا۟ عَلَىٰ وَادِ ٱلنَّمْلِ <mark>قَالَتْ</mark> نَمْلَةٌ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّمْلُ ٱدْخُلُوا۟ مَسَٰكِنَكُمْ لَا يَحْطِمَنَّكُمْ سُلَيْمَٰنُ وَجُنُودُهُۥ وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ ۝ فَتَبَسَّمَ ضَاحِكًا مِّن <mark>قَوْلِهَا</mark> وَقَالَ رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِىٓ أَنْ أَشْكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَىَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَىَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَٰلِحًا تَرْضَىٰهُ وَأَدْخِلْنِى بِرَحْمَتِكَ فِى عِبَادِكَ ٱلصَّٰلِحِينَ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Till, when they reached the Valley of the Ants, an ant <mark>exclaimed</mark>: "O ants! Enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his armies crush you, unperceiving." And (Solomon) smiled, laughing at <mark>her speech</mark>, and said: "My Lord, arouse me to be thankful for Thy favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and to do good that shall be pleasing unto Thee, and include me in (the number of) Thy righteous slaves."</p>

As mentioned above; Solomon overhears a "conversation of ants." This is impossible based on our knowledge about the mode and complexity of ant communication.

## Refutation
Before we continue, I'd like to point out that the critic really has got to grab some books and educate himself about stridulation:
> "The act of producing sound by rubbing together certain body parts; a behavior mostly associated with insects along with a number of species of fish, snakes and spiders."

The critic is attempting to ridicule this story because of his naturalistic views and disbelief in supernatural miracles. Solomon had the supernatural ability to understand and speak with all animals, and as we know, all animals have their unique styles of communication, and they differ from one another; using voices, stridulation, gestures and motions, electrical pulses, bioluminescence, the releasing of chemicals and toxins, etc.

As for this verse, we have the word "naml (نمل)" in Arabic, which is a word for "ants" as well as "termites." Ants are usually called in Arabic "an-Naml al-Abyad (النمل الأبيض)," meaning "the white ants."

Not only do ants communicate by sound, but even termites are specifically known to communicate by sound; their acoustic communication has been thoroughly researched and documented in countless studies, such as:
* **[Analysis of Acoustic Communication by Ants](<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12274195_Analysis_of_acoustic_communication_by_ants>)**
* **[The Bioacoustics of Ants](<https://agosto-foundation.org/the-bioacoustics-of-ants>)**

Even if that absolutely ends the argument right there, we'll take it a step further; Muslim scholars have stated that due to the verses preceding **[27:18-19](<https://quranx.com/27.18-19>)**, it can be strongly adduced that these are winged ants or possible winged termites:

### **<strong>27:16</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَٰنُ دَاوُۥدَ ۖ وَقَالَ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ عُلِّمْنَا مَنطِقَ <mark>ٱلطَّيْرِ</mark> وَأُوتِينَا مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْمُبِينُ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Solomon was heir to David, and he said: "O people, we have been taught the language of <mark>Tayr</mark>, and have been given of everything. This is a clear favour indeed."</p>

The word "tayr (طير)" implies any winged creature that has the ability to fly. This word literally means to fly, as the words "ta'ir (طائر)" and "ta'irah (طائرة)," meaning "bird" and "airplane," also derive from the same root of "tayr" in the Arabic language.

Those "naml" had two wings, thus they were categorized as "tayr." I use the word "naml" instead of "ant" and "tayr" instead of "bird," since the English translations have failed to capture these linguistic nuances which must be explained:

### **<strong>Tafsir al-Qurtubi (27:18)</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">كان للنملة جناحان فصارت من الطير، فلذلك علم منطقها ولولا ذلك لما علمه.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">That ant had two wings, becoming one of the Tayr, thus he knew her speech, and without that he wouldn't have known it.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

It is well known that termites communicate by sound and this does not require any posting of a research paper. What is interesting to note is that wings in ants is a sign of unmated males and females, as they are called "winged reproductive" or "swarmer." This is because they leave their mounds en masse to mate. Hence, the verse mentions that these ants are not in their mounds but out in the open. This verse uses the feminine verb "qalat (قالت)," meaning "she said," regarding the ant that warned the others. Thus, it was perhaps a winged, unmated queen.

Now shush, critic. [Be nice and give the ants a chance to talk!](<https://www.science.org/content/article/shhh-ants-are-talking>)
