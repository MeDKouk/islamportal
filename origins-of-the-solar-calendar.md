Here now I wish to address the Christian Solar calendar and its pagan origins. The majority of the Western world follows this Solar calendar, as was implemented by the Christian Church centuries ago. It should be noted, however, that at one time; Christians, Muslims and Jews altogether followed the Lunar calendar. Today, Muslims and Jews still adhere to the Lunar calendar, whereas the rest of the world, with a few exceptions, adhere to the Solar calendar.

A small side note here; the Solar calendar is somewhat imperfect. It is this imperfection that causes the addition of an extra day in February every four years. This is called a "Leap Year." I will not be discussing astronomy, but rather the origins of this specific calendar, and nothing more. 

When civilization was still young, and before people knew any better, the most brilliant object they could see was the sun. They thought the sun was God and as such worshipped it. This pagan idea remained with the Christians when they changed the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday) to the Christian day of rest (Sunday). The Christians called this rest day "Sun-day," a day dedicated to the Roman sun-god. This pagan idea also had an influence on the names of the months as we shall now explore.

## January
The Roman year originally began in March, but when the calendar was revised by Gregory the 13th, the Christian Pope, January was made the first month in dedication of Janus, a Roman god who was represented as having two faces, one looking backward and the other forward. Pope Gregory the 13th took this into consideration when making January the first month of the year because it suggested both looking back and looking forward.

## February
February was named after Februa, the Roman feast of purification. Before Julius Caesar, it was the last month of the year but it was placed as the second month on the Roman calendar, and the Christians did likewise in their calendar.

## March
Mars, the god of war, gave his name to the month of March, for the Romans considered it a noisy and blustering month. When they went to war, they carried a cage full of chickens, which was sacred to Mars. Before the battle, they offered corn to the chickens; if the chickens rejected the corn, the Romans feared defeat, however, if the chickens ate the corn, the Romans were confident of victory.

## April
The month of April, which heralds the spring season in the northern hemisphere, takes the name "The Opener" from nature’s opening "Omnia Aperit," which is Latin for "It Opens All Things." It was named as such because it is during this month, in the northern hemisphere, that the earth awakens from its winter sleep. The buds appear and bloom in the branches. The birds rejoice and it is heard in their songs. Oddly enough, this is also the time of the year of the Christian Easter celebrations.

## May
May was dedicated to and received its name from Maia, a female worshipped as a goddess, whose father was Atlas, where the whole weight of the world was supposed to have rested on his shoulders. Of his seven daughters, Maia was considered to be the most famous because of her beauty and her lovely figure. Her son Mercury became the winged messenger of the gods. Christians now consider May to be the month of Mary, the mother of Prophet Jesus. It is easy to see the similarities between Maia and Mercury to that of Mary and Jesus.

## June
June was considered by the Romans as the month of roses. It was dedicated to Juno, the jealous, but beautiful wife of the Roman god Jupiter. Juno is represented in her statues and pictures driving in a chariot drawn by peacocks.

## July
Julius Caesar, considered to be one of the greatest men of his time, gave his own name to July. He ordered the seventh month to be named after him. Pope Gregory the 13th held Julius Caesar in high esteem and as such his name was carried over unchanged into the Gregorian calendar.

## August
August here owes its name to the grand nephew of Julius Caesar, Augustus, who was first named Octavius. In order to flatter him, the people around him changed his name to Augustus, which means "Noble," however, since July had 31 days and August only 30 days, the Romans took a day from September and placed it in August, fearing that Augustus might be jealous of Julius Caesar's extra day in the month of July.

## September, October, November, December
The name September comes from the Latin word for seventh, as do the names October, November and December, which means eight, ninth and tenth, respectively. These months kept their names from the time when the year began in March, before the time of Julius Caesar and was adopted into the Gregorian calendar. Oddly enough, December is also the birth month of the Roman sun-god which also influenced the decision to make January the first month of the new Christian calendar. The events of the birth of the Roman sun-god has now become Christian dogma as pertaining to the birth of Prophet Jesus.

***

Though the Gregorian calendar came into force long after the birth of Prophet Jesus, the Christian church was reluctant to sever its ties, its links and its umbilical cord from its idolatrous, pagan past. It is little wonder that Israel Zangwill, a Jewish author, summed up this phenomenon with these words:
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>VI - Comedy or Tragedy? (404) [^1] </strong>**
<p style="text-align:center;">Scratch the Christian and you will find the pagan-spoiled.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

My only wish was to show the extent in which paganism has crept into the lives of Christians and much of the world over the centuries. While there is no obligation of the part of non-Muslims to relinquish their following of the Gregorian calendar, it is incumbent upon all who profess Islam as religion and call themselves Muslims to adhere solely to the Islamic Lunar calendar, not allowing themselves to become influenced with the Christian Solar calendar, which, without question, has its roots in pagan beliefs. As Muslims, we must strive to everything in our power to please Allah (ﷻ), and to avoid such idolatrous practices, focusing all our worship for Allah (ﷻ), to Whom all Praise is due. Christians must come to realize that any celebrations that have become ritualistic dogma over the centuries were never promulgated by Prophet Jesus, nor were they practiced by him. Prophet Jesus' sole purpose was to propagate monotheism; attributing these pagan concepts to this great Messenger of Allah (ﷻ) would only serve to further dishonour him.
