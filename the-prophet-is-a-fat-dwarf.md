### **<strong>Abu Dawud 4749</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ السَّلاَمِ بْنُ أَبِي حَازِمٍ أَبُو طَالُوتَ، قَالَ: شَهِدْتُ أَبَا بَرْزَةَ دَخَلَ عَلَى عُبَيْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ زِيَادٍ فَحَدَّثَنِي فُلاَنٌ، سَمَّاهُ مُسْلِمٌ وَكَانَ فِي السِّمَاطِ فَلَمَّا رَآهُ عُبَيْدُ اللَّهِ قَالَ:‏ <mark>إِنَّ مُحَمَّدِيَّكُمْ هَذَا الدَّحْدَاحُ، فَفَهِمَهَا الشَّيْخُ</mark> فَقَالَ: مَا كُنْتُ أَحْسِبُ أَنِّي أَبْقَى فِي قَوْمٍ يُعَيِّرُونِي بِصُحْبَةِ مُحَمَّدٍ (ﷺ) فَقَالَ لَهُ عُبَيْدُ اللَّهِ إِنَّ صُحْبَةَ مُحَمَّدٍ (ﷺ) لَكَ زَيْنٌ غَيْرُ شَيْنٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ:‏ إِنَّمَا بُعِثْتُ إِلَيْكَ لأَسْأَلَكَ عَنِ الْحَوْضِ سَمِعْتَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ (ﷺ) يَذْكُرُ فِيهِ شَيْئًا فَقَالَ أَبُو بَرْزَةَ:‏ نَعَمْ لاَ مَرَّةً وَلاَ ثِنْتَيْنِ وَلاَ ثَلاَثًا وَلاَ أَرْبَعًا وَلاَ خَمْسًا، فَمَنْ كَذَّبَ بِهِ فَلاَ سَقَاهُ اللَّهُ مِنْهُ ثُمَّ خَرَجَ مُغْضَبًا.‏</p></h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Abdus-Salam ibn Abu Hazim said:</b> I saw Abu Barzah who came to visit Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad. Then a man named Muslim who was there in the company mentioned it to me. When Ubaydullah saw him, he said: "<mark>This Muhammad of yours is a fat dwarf." The old man (i.e. Abu Barzah) understood it</mark>. So he said: "I don't think that I should remain among people who criticize me for having had the company of Muhammad (ﷺ)." Thereupon Ubaydullah said to him: "The company of Muhammad (ﷺ) is a honour for you, not a disgrace." He added: "I called for you to ask about the Haud (reservoir or cistern). Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say anything about it?" Abu Barzah said: "Yes, not once, twice, thrice, four times or five times. Whoever disbelieves in it, may Allah not supply him with water from it." He then went away angrily.</p>

The fact that the old man Abu Barzah "understood it" implies that Ubaydullah's description of the Prophet (ﷺ) as a fat dwarf was accurate.

## Refutation
Look at how the critic twists the facts, utterly disgusting; the critic is jumping with joy at this narration, going forth miles in coming up with strange analysis based on it, but if only he simply took some time to properly read it and understand it, things may have been different.

There is a complete mistranslation here; Ubaydullah's reference never included the Prophet (ﷺ) in his mockery, he only called Abu Barzah, the Companion of the Prophet (ﷺ), a "Muhammadan" in an insulting tone; he used the word "Muhammadeekum (محمديكم)," meaning "this Muhammadi of yours," and not "Muhammadakum (محمدكم)," meaning "this Muhammad of yours," which clearly shows that he was referring to Abu Barzah as a Muhammadan, and this is because he was a Companion of the Prophet (ﷺ). The correct translation would be:
> "This <mark>Muhammadan</mark> of yours is a fat dwarf."

He mocked Abu Barzah by calling him a fat dwarf, and he understood it by replying that he is being mocked for being a Companion (i.e. Muhammadan). If you're being skeptical about the mistranslation, then check out **[Sunnah.com](<https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4749>)**'s accurate translation:

Even if we assume that the mockery was against the Prophet (ﷺ), how does that mean that it was accurate? Ubaydullah has never saw the Prophet (ﷺ), while the entirety of the Companions who met him described him otherwise. From here we clearly see that the critic came up with a total blunder, coupled with deliberate trickery by taking advantage of the mistranslation.
