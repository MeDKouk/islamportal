## Allegation
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>17:92</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">أَوْ <mark>تُسْقِطَ ٱلسَّمَآءَ</mark> كَمَا زَعَمْتَ <mark>عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا</mark> أَوْ تَأْتِىَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ قَبِيلًا ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Or <mark>cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces</mark>, as you have claimed, or bring Allah and the angels before us, face to face.</p>


### **<strong>22:65</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱلْفُلْكَ تَجْرِى فِى ٱلْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِۦ وَ<mark>يُمْسِكُ ٱلسَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ</mark> إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِۦٓ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِٱلنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Have you not seen how Allah has made all that is in the earth subservient unto you? And the ship runs upon the sea by His command, and <mark>He holds back the heaven from falling on the earth</mark> unless by His leave. Lo! Allah is, for mankind, Full of Pity, Merciful.</p>


### **<strong>34:9</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">أَفَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ ۚ إِن نَّشَأْ نَخْسِفْ بِهِمُ ٱلْأَرْضَ أَوْ <mark>نُسْقِطْ عَلَيْهِمْ كِسَفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ</mark> ۚ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَءَايَةً لِّكُلِّ عَبْدٍ مُّنِيبٍ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">See they not what is before them and behind them, of the sky and the earth? If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or <mark>cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them</mark>. Verily in this is a Sign for every devotee that turns to Allah (in repentance).</p>


### **<strong>52:44</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ <mark>كِسْفًا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ سَاقِطًا</mark> يَقُولُوا۟ سَحَابٌ مَّرْكُومٌ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And if they were to see <mark>a fragment of the heaven falling</mark>, they would say: "A heap of clouds."</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

The Quran describes the sky as a roof held up by Allah (ﷻ) that can fall or fragments of which may break off and fall upon unfortunate individuals. This is challenging in light of the modern realization that the sky is simply a conglomeration of various gasses.

## Refutation
There are things in the sky that can fall on earth; meteorites, comets, etc., and if they were to fall on the earth, they would cause much harm to its people. Those celestial bodies are portions and fragments of the sky, since they exist within it. What is meant by preventing the fall of the sky on the earth is preventing its celestial bodies and planets from falling on the earth; Allah (ﷻ) prevents them, out of His Mercy to us, from falling on the earth, and if Allah (ﷻ) had willed, then He would have let them fall on us.

In Arabic grammar, if part of a thing is concerned, you can refer to all of it. As an example:

### **<strong>71:7</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَإِنِّى كُلَّمَا دَعَوْتُهُمْ لِتَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ <mark>جَعَلُوٓا۟ أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ</mark> وَٱسْتَغْشَوْا۟ ثِيَابَهُمْ وَأَصَرُّوا۟ وَٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ ٱسْتِكْبَارًا ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And whenever I invite them to be forgiven by You, they <mark>press their fingers into their ears</mark>, cover themselves with their clothes, persist (in denial), and act very arrogantly.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

This may seem illogical if it's taken literally, because only the tip top of their fingers is inserted.

Another example:
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>44:3</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّآ <mark>أَنزَلْنَٰهُ فِى لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَٰرَكَةٍ</mark> ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُنذِرِينَ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">We <mark>sent it down during a Blessed Night</mark>; for We (ever) wish to warn (against Evil).</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

"It" here refers to the Quran. This verse also is illogical if read in a literal way, since the revelation of the Quran took a total of 23 years, not one single night. If read in its full context, only a few verses were revealed at that night, therefore, refering to the full thing if part of it is concerned is a totally normal rule in Arabic grammar.

As for **52:44**, there's simply an occurence of obfuscation in translation done by most English translators; the verse employs the use of the preposition "min (من)," which means more "from" than "of." The meaning, of course, stays unanimously correct if "of" is employed, but it would be confusing to say it in English because it implies that the fragment is one piece of a solid sky, therefore, a more comprehensive translation would be:
> "A fragment <mark>from</mark> the heaven."

This is not a "scientific error," this is lack of contextual understanding.
