## Copyright
There is no copyright on Islamic materials.

First and foremost, we wish to point out that there is no such thing as "intellectual copyright" in Islam. A person cannot quote Quran and Sunnah or anything related to this religion and claim it for himself, this religion belongs to Allah (ﷻ) alone:
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>3:19</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْإِسْلَٰمُ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

We, as Muslims, are commanded to convey this religion without seeking earthly rewards or special mentions from other people, for the reward we seek for conveying this religion should only be sought from Allah (ﷻ):
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>36:17</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا عَلَيْنَآ إِلَّا ٱلْبَلَٰغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And our duty is only to convey plainly (the Message).</p>


### **<strong>26:109</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَمَآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ ۖ إِنْ أَجْرِىَ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message), my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

Secondly, the confusion most people have is that one may be compensated financially for producing content for his effort in production, etc., however, once the product is brought by the buyer he has the right of disposal to do as he wishes with the CD, DVD, book, etc. This includes to copy the material and distribute it freely if he wishes. The original seller cannot stipulate any conditions on the buyer once the goods has left his hands.

Finally, "copyright" is an innovation of the non-Muslims; if we look to our Islamic history, we do not find our scholars copyrighting their works, rather they made it available for the Muslim brotherhood, so that they could benefit from the knowledge. Unfortunately, with the age of technology, some Muslims have started to practice something that which never existed in Islam and are following the innovation of copyright.

This is a green light for reproduction. You have the right to do as you wish with my works, as long as they're in favor of sending awareness about Islam.
