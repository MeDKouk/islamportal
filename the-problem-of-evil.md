## Allegation
The world appears to contain states of affairs that are bad, undesirable, and should have been prevented by any being that could have done so. The existence of pure evil is incompatible with the existence of Allah (ﷻ).

## Refutation
Blaming Allah (ﷻ) whilst not even believing in the concept of theism is one of the silliest trump cards ever for atheists to use against Him, mostly used when the Holocaust or any recent catastrophe is brought up. This is a mere emotional reaction that I'm going to break apart with logical reasoning, so if you're allergic to facts; leave.

First of all, the reason this argument is brought forward is that the average atheist can't give a purpose for life, so here I'm going to build my reasoning on an objective and strong foundation; according to the Islamic meaning of life, which is that we are under religious assignment. We are here to obey Allah (ﷻ) and follow his commandments, so that we go to Paradise and pass the test:

The existence of evil, trials and calamities, is in itself the greatest evidence of the validity of the issue of religion and the error of atheism.

If we were the children of the material world, we would not comprehend neither good nor evil.If the entire universe were meaningless, we would not perceive at all that it is meaningless. Because according to the atheistic view, we follow strict material imperatives, and the laws of nature apply to us, and in this context we will not comprehend the essence of evil nor the meaning of evil.

So, do the most sophisticated animals perceive the paradox of evil?In fact, understanding evil means that we are not children of this materialistic world, and that we derive our understanding of the existence of evil from a premise other than the Darwinian materialist premise of existence.Instead, we belong to a divine premise, not to a materialistic, earthly atheistic model, and this is the only explanation why we comprehend evil. As long as we are charged with religious assignment, it is natural that there are trials and affliction, and it is natural for us to perceive the meaning of evil.

Evil, some pain, and the ability to commit disobedience is the natural requirement and self-evidence outcome of free will and divine assignment. The existence of evil, affliction, calamities, and desires disclose the best of a good person and the worst of a corrupt person.

It is astonishing that atheists deny the existence of the Creator because there is evil; they use the following analysis:
1. If the father is benevolent and likes good for his son, then why did he allow him to be given a painful injection against microbes?
2. Does the son suffer pain as a result of the injection?
3. Then, the father does not exist.

Is this a logical analysis?No. Moreover, it is natural that we do not understand all the subtleties of divine wisdom in good and evil.

Allah (ﷻ) has disclosed the wisdom of al-Khadir's actions with Moses (peace 
be upon him), even though they are actions that are apparently disapproved and rejected, but they involve abundant good. Also, the story of Moses and al-Khadir was not mentioned in the Quran as a form of narrative or storytelling, but as a matter of reflection and acknowledgment of the deficiency of the human soul and its hasty judgment.

What is even more astonishing about the issue of evil is that if there were no evil in the world, you would not have left the place where you were born, asno civilization would have existed, nor cities, factories, or homes would 
be built, nor would people need work, nor would people think of resisting a disease, solving a problem, or even inventing an idea to bring about convenience, nor would a person need to move from his place of birth in the first place. For there is no evil, no trouble, no affliction, no fatigue, and no problems for which we should look for solutions!

So why toil, stay up late, think, and work?Evil is an imperative necessity in this world.Many people go through affliction and evil, then they return to Allah (ﷻ) and become righteous. There is a wisdom and good in all Allah (ﷻ)'s predestinations.A Muslim must believe in all Allah (ﷻ)'s predestinations, and he's required to accept the predestination of Allah (ﷻ), with its good and evil aspects:
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>Muslim 8a</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">(الإِيمَانُ) أَنْ تُؤْمِنَ بِاللَّهِ وَمَلاَئِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الآخِرِ وَتُؤْمِنَ بِ<mark>الْقَدَرِ خَيْرِهِ وَشَرِّهِ</mark>.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">(Faith is) that you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the <mark>Divine Decree about good and evil</mark>.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

In fact, all of Allah (ﷻ)'s predestination is good, even if some of it seems outwardly to be evil, distressful, or harmful, but in the end they include great good and extensive divine wisdom.

Now, off from the religious refutation to a more logically comprehensive refutation, for an atheist, at least; a well-known logical saying goes like this:
> "A thing is known only by its opposite."

Stars don't shine in the daylight; there has to be darkness so that we know what the bright light of the stars are like. Light and dark must coexist for one side to exist, pretty much, and that's applicable to every pair of opposites; 

Similarly; if there was no goodness, there wouldn't be evilness. There is no way for a human being to be conscious of the meaning of good if there was no evil, nor to discern good from evil.

Therefore, we'd live in a world without evil nor good; a completely meaningless and purposeless world. This is pretty much the atheist belief.

One might bring up that Allah (ﷻ) can make good can exist without evil, but if that's the case, free will would not exist as well, because we'd be forced only to commit goodness, and the ability of commiting evil deeds would be entirely prohibited. This conflates with the purpose of life, which is solely built on the free will of human beings.

Imagine if that's the case; when the Day of Resurrection comes, everybody would enter Paradise, but that'd be completely unjust, as there could be a group of people that if they had the opportunity to do evil, they would have done it out of will, and this is unfair, because the people who had the opportunity to commit evil deeds and did not commit them are more deserving of Paradise than the people who wanted to.

Allah (ﷻ) possesses absolute knowledge, so how can He enter these people into Paradise and make them equal to the other people who, if evil was made available to them, they would not have done it? This is complete injustice, unless you think that the righteous deserves to be on the same level to that of the most vile of men.

Don't you think evil is brings only disasters, for is it only a trial; it opens the door to good. For example; someone was afflicted with a calamity, and it was a door to his repentance. Evil, here, led to good. If you prevent evil, you have closed one of the doors of goodness. Allah (ﷻ) is absolutely good, so He must give all good, and all good requires the existence of evil, as we have previously logically explained.

In addition, evil must exist for the world to exist. Bare with me on this; the world, theoretically and according to some, came from an explosion known as the "Big Bang," and this explosion created a universe that consists of stars that turn into black holes destroying everything around it. The existence of black holes is important to the universe, of course, as they provide us with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, which can be considered as the origin of life.

The problem here is that the stars explode to transform themselves into black holes, destroying then planets, moons, and other stars in close proximity, with the possibility of living beings in them. This is pure evil, but it's necessary for black holes to form in order to preserve the universe. Evil is necessary for the existence of the universe, and this is a simple example.

One very important point is that two of Allah (ﷻ)'s beautiful names implying his absolute mercy are "The Most Merciful" and "The Bestower of Mercy." In order to have mercy on a person, he must sin or do something wrong so that you can do it. Doing wrong requires the existence of evil, therefore, because Allah (ﷻ)'s attribute is mercy, which is one of the many forms of goodness, this requires the existence of evil.

To an atheist, this argument is as much of a joke as that which he is! Atheistically and materialistically, there are absolutely no objective definitions of morality (i.e. what is good and what is evil), as we have already explained in one of our articles, **[[atheism-and-morality|Atheism and Morality]]**, so how dare he even argue on this topic!?

Atheists really do be arguing about good and evil, whereas these things don't even exist in a material world without Allah (ﷻ). How long is this absurd tomfoolery going to persist!? [I'm going insane](<https://youtu.be/2WffauydMF4>).
