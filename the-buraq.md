## Allegation
Muslims claim that Muhammad (ﷺ) flew on a winged horse to the seven heavens.

## Refutation
There is no description of a "winged horse" anywhere in the entirety of hadith literature, and I'm actually going to take my time listing every single shred of evidence proving my point:

### **<strong>Bukhari 3207</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">أُتِيتُ ب<mark>دَابَّةٍ أبْيَضَ، دُونَ البَغْلِ وفَوْقَ الحِمَارِ؛ البُرَاقُ</mark>، فَانْطَلَقْتُ مع جِبْرِيلَ.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Al-Buraq; <mark>a white animal, smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey</mark> was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel.</p>


### **<strong>Bukhari 3887</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">ثُمَّ أُتِيتُ ب<mark>دَابَّةٍ دُونَ البَغْلِ، وفَوْقَ الحِمَارِ أبْيَضَ</mark>، يَضَعُ خَطْوَهُ عِنْدَ أقْصَى طَرْفِهِ، فَحُمِلْتُ عليه، فَانْطَلَقَ بي جِبْرِيلُ حتَّى أتَى السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Then <mark>a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey</mark> was brought to me, the animal's step was so wide that it reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal's sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.</p>


### **<strong>Muslim 164a</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">ثُمَّ أُتِيتُ بِ<mark>دَابَّةٍ أَبْيَضَ يُقَالُ لَهُ الْبُرَاقُ فَوْقَ الْحِمَارِ وَدُونَ الْبَغْلِ</mark> يَقَعُ خَطْوُهُ عِنْدَ أَقْصَى طَرْفِهِ فَحُمِلْتُ عَلَيْهِ ثُمَّ انْطَلَقْنَا حَتَّى أَتَيْنَا السَّمَاءَ الدُّنْيَا.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">I was then brought <mark>a white beast which is called al-Buraq, bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule</mark>. Its stride was as long as the eye could reach. I was mounted on it, and then we went forth till we reached the lowest heaven.</p>


### **<strong>Muslim 162a</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">أُتِيتُ بِالْبُرَاقِ، وَهُوَ <mark>دَابَّةٌ أَبْيَضُ طَوِيلٌ فَوْقَ الْحِمَارِ وَدُونَ الْبَغْلِ</mark> يَضَعُ حَافِرَهُ عِنْدَ مُنْتَهَى طَرْفِهِ.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">I was brought al-Buraq, who is <mark>an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule</mark>, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version.</p>

With all such proof from the same sources the critic despises so much; it becomes evident that the creature Muhammad (ﷺ) was riding (i.e. the Buraq) wasn't winged, and was neither the size of a donkey nor a mule, but something in between.

In addition, it was used only for the traveling between Mecca and Jerusalem; the Buraq was tethered when the Prophet (ﷺ) reached Jerusalem, and the ascension was with Archangel Gabriel, further disproving this "space donkey" retardation:

### **<strong>Muslim 162a</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">فَرَكِبْتُهُ حَتَّى أَتَيْتُ بَيْتَ الْمَقْدِسِ، <mark>فَرَبَطْتُهُ بِالْحَلْقَةِ الَّتِي يَرْبِطُ بِهِ الأَنْبِيَاءُ</mark>.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then <mark>tethered it to the ring used by the prophets</mark>.</p>

The paintings which those people almost always attribute to this creature are all false Judeo-Persian, Mughal, Kashmiri and Safavid depictions that have no basis in Islam. Yes, those weird Hindu deity-like things:

Even if the Buraq flew at all, what does that hold? And what argument is supposed to be made against Islam here? Human beings have become so technologically advanced to a point where they built rockets to go into space, while Allah (ﷻ), Who we claim to be the Creator and the Sustainer of Everything, apparently can't find a way to ease the job for His beloved Prophet, Muhammad (ﷺ), to penetrate the atmosphere? What sheer nonsense.

I find it kind of intriguing how people find this story of "Muhammad (ﷺ) went to space" absurd and frowned upon while the same people claim that a girl is trapped inside of a boy's body, or vice versa.
