## Allegation
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>11:5</strong>**

<h3><p style="text-align:center;">أَلَآ إِنَّهُمْ <mark>يَثْنُونَ صُدُورَهُمْ لِيَسْتَخْفُوا۟ مِنْهُ</mark> ۚ أَلَا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">Behold! Now they <mark>fold up their breasts that they may hide (their thoughts) from Him</mark>. At the very moment when they cover themselves with their clothing, Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim. He is Aware of what is in the breasts (of men).</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

Allah (ﷻ) thinks that humans have their brains in their breasts.

## Refutation
It's obviously a common figure of speech which we still use today. Have you not heard somebody ask "tell me what is in your heart," perhaps? Maybe not, nobody cares about you anyways.

It's not taken literally, it simply represents the innermost feelings, thoughts or secrets.

Commentaries on this verse also show that the reference to "the breasts" is concerning the "innermost secrets." The Quran is not saying people have brains in their hearts, and the critic must take us for fools if he thinks people cannot see it as an idiom.

The Quran is not in error, but the critic is being the unreasonable fool he keeps being.
