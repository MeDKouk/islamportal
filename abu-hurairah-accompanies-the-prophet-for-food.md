### **<strong>Bukhari 5432</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ: <mark>كُنْتُ أَلْزَمُ النَّبِيَّ (ﷺ) لِشِبَعِ بَطْنِي</mark> حِينَ لاَ آكُلُ الْخَمِيرَ، وَلاَ أَلْبَسُ الْحَرِيرَ، وَلاَ يَخْدُمُنِي فُلاَنٌ وَلاَ فُلاَنَةُ، وَأُلْصِقُ بَطْنِي بِالْحَصْبَاءِ، وَأَسْتَقْرِئُ الرَّجُلَ الآيَةَ وَهْىَ مَعِي كَىْ يَنْقَلِبَ بِي فَيُطْعِمَنِي، وَخَيْرُ النَّاسِ لِلْمَسَاكِينِ جَعْفَرُ بْنُ أَبِي طَالِبٍ، يَنْقَلِبُ بِنَا فَيُطْعِمُنَا مَا كَانَ فِي بَيْتِهِ، حَتَّى إِنْ كَانَ لَيُخْرِجُ إِلَيْنَا الْعُكَّةَ لَيْسَ فِيهَا شَىْءٌ، فَنَشْتَقُّهَا فَنَلْعَقُ مَا فِيهَا‏.‏</p></h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Abu Hurairah said:</b> <mark>I used to accompany Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to fill my stomach</mark> and that was when I did not eat baked bread, nor wear silk. Neither a male nor a female slave used to serve me, and I used to bind stones over my belly and ask somebody to recite a Quranic Verse for me though I knew it, so that he might take me to his house and feed me. Jafar bin Abi Talib was very kind to the poor, and he used to take us and feed us with what ever was available in his house, (and if nothing was available), he used to give us the empty (honey or butter) skin which we would tear and lick whatever was in it.</p>

Abu Hurairah was one of the most famous hadith narrators. In this hadith, he admits that the only reason he followed Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) around so much, and hence knew a lot of narrations, was because he was poor, and that if he followed the Prophet (ﷺ) he would always be assured of a free meal.

## Refutation
Yet again; the critic astonishes us with his imaginative theories! But little did he know that he was building a castle on sand. To be honest, this one got me thinking for a while, until I found an Arabic explanation on **[Dorar.net](<https://www.dorar.net/hadith/sharh/150615>)**, thus realizing this was just a cherry-picking issue.

Abu Hurairah here tells us that he was attached to the Prophet (ﷺ) for the reason of "filling his stomach," but there is a mistranslation here that turns the hadith to be completely out of context. **Bukhari 5432** clearly contains a mistake related to translation because **Bukhari 3708**, a similar hadith, is translated completely differently on **[Sunnah.com](<https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3708>)**:

### **<strong>Bukhari 3708</strong>**
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Abu Hurairah said:</b> <mark>I used to keep close to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and was satisfied with what filled my stomach</mark>. I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Qur'anic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja`far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.</p>

To make better sense of everything; in Arabic, it's "li-shiba'i batni (لشبع بطني)," which can be translated to "for the fullness of my belly" or "because of my satisfaction with what filled my stomach." This translation fits the narrative better, but even if the translation is fixed, it still doesn't picture the whole meaning behind it, leaving it unexplained.

"For the fullness of my belly" is an Arabic metaphor for his lack of busyness and his possession of too much free-time, and this is exactly why he was limiting himself to what he resides in the way of seeking knowledge and accompanying the Prophet (ﷺ), not asking for extras, despite his destitution.

The second part of the hadith where he gets fed by Jafar bin Abi Talib has nothing to do with him using the company of the Prophet (ﷺ) as a bait for people to fill his stomach or quench his thirst, as the critic wishes to imagine; it's only to emphasize that he was a completely poor person who can't provide for himself, and instead of wasting his life on begging, he has sacrificed the rest of his life to the company of the Prophet (ﷺ), and that was when people used to question the large number of his narrations unlike anyone from the ancient Companions, despite his delay in his conversion to Islam, and the short period he spent in the company of the Prophet (ﷺ).

Abu Hurairah has never used the Prophet (ﷺ) as a bait for food, or any other worldly gain, in the same way you critics do by throwing allegations left and right, unaware of their flaws. May Allah (ﷻ) be pleased with him, and all the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) likewise.
