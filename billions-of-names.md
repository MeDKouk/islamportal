## Allegation
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>2:31</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ <mark>ٱلْأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا</mark> ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنۢبِـُٔونِى بِأَسْمَآءِ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And He taught Adam <mark>all the names</mark>, then showed them to the angels, saying: "Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful."</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

Allah (ﷻ) taught Adam all the names of the plants and animals, which must have taken a while, since there are 1.7 million species that are known today, with probably another 10 million or so that are yet to be discovered. This only includes those that are alive today. If extinct species are included (~99%), then Allah (ﷻ) must have taught Adam a billion or so names, and this only applies to the living species, so let alone other countless objects, planets, stars, matter, etc.

## Refutation
The critic is being flippant, using manipulative exaggeration to make this seem like a scientific blunder. If he read some Tafsir books, he would note that Allah (ﷻ) taught Adam the names by placing knowledge of them into his heart:

### **<strong>Tafsir al-Jalalayn (2:31)</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ ٱلْأَسْمَآءَ، أي أسماء المسميات، كُلَّهَا، بأن ألقى في قلبه علمها.‏</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And He taught Adam the names, that is, the names of things named, all of them, by placing knowledge of them into his heart.</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

So if the critic thought a little laterally, or just read the Tafsir which shouldn't take him longer than two minutes, he wouldn't really make the claim of taking a lot of time.

Even it the process was done word by word, what gives you the authority to make it seem so lenghty in time? It's literally Allah (ﷻ) Himself teaching Adam, and He has the ability to make the process fast in any way.
