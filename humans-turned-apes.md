## Allegation
<!-- tabs:start -->

### **<strong>2:65</strong>**
<h3><p style="text-align:center;">وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱعْتَدَوْا۟ مِنكُمْ فِى ٱلسَّبْتِ فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ <mark>كُونُوا۟ قِرَدَةً</mark> خَٰسِـِٔينَ ۝</p></h3>

***

<p style="text-align:center;">And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath, We said to them: "<mark>Be ye apes</mark>, despised and rejected."</p>

<!-- tabs:end -->

The Quran records a miraculous event where Sabbath breakers are transformed into apes. There is, however, no scientific evidence that humans were ever transformed into apes.

## Refutation
Yet somehow, the same people believe that apes were transformed gradually into homosapiens.

This isn't an error at all; the absence of evidence doesn't point out to the degree of its falsity and incorrectness. How about you actually present evidence disproving this event instead, which happened thousands of years ago, with a specific range of people?

"Humans being turned apes" is a supernatural  punishment, which was ordered by Allah (ﷻ). The critic here is again trying to ridicule this story through his naturalistic rhetoric against religious miracles.
