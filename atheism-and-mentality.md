Having all the evidence but still rejecting the idea of theism isn't a problem of acceptance; it's a mental problem.

Sometimes, psychological problems are often the main driver of atheism and suspicion; one of those atheists may suffocate with depression, stumbling with obsessive thoughts and beginning to question Allah (ï·»)'s Wisdom or object to his predestination.

Those kinds of suspicions will never cease to desist or return to their senses with argumentation and mental responses, because psychological illness has the power to drive minds to a very detestable place; the only solution is psychological treatment.

Whoever takes the lead in responding to suspicions using argumentation must know the background of the person to whom he is responding to, instead of trying to persuade him. Nobody should ever imagine that all those who suffer from doubts and obsessions have pure misunderstandings, and that their treatment is logic and reason.

In many cases, these people only need a bit of comfort and containment to remove obsessions and suspicions from them. A depressed person is like a drowning man who does not know how to act, so he flounders in search of any solution; sometimes he will blame himself, and sometimes he will blame society, and it may come to him a time where the blame is fully put onto religion or Allah (ï·») Himself, being the Creator of Everything.

Therefore, he may perform unaccounted actions such as self-harm, harming others, or just throwing one's self into the bottomless pit of atheism, as an attempt to get rid of the suffocating feeling that he does not know how to get rid of.

The main problem why most atheists can't get their acts together is the highly elevated prices of psychiatry sessions; they're a disaster, not only for atheists, but for many other people. The specialists must search for urgent solutions to them, such as group psychotherapy sessions to reduce costs, or providing accessible courses for free or at nominal prices to train patients or their relatives on how to deal with psychological illnesses.
