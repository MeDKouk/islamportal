There is a widespread deceptive tactic used by non-Muslims as a way to slander Islam, which is to address the refutation of their claims in a short unexplained method, making the readers think that the refutation is invalid, ignoring then the full detailed refutation of the claims in other sources.

For example, we see at the filthy trash of a site, **[WikiIslam.net](<https://wikiislam.net>)**, many uses of this tactic where they exclaim:
> "Muslim apologists claim that ..."
> 
> "Muslim apologists often interpret it as if ..."

Notice how the writers deceive the readers by referring to the Muslims by the term "apologists," as a way to make it as if those Muslims are apologetic, and they aren't to be trusted as a source of information. What the writers truly claim the "Muslim apologists" say is only their short summarized analysis of the refutation, without any further explanation from the original source, thus providing an unclear vision that eventually leads to ignorance of the other side's explanations.
