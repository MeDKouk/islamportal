## Allegation
Kind of a hot take, but teaching children about a place full of agonising punishments in which they'll burn forever should be categorised as child abuse, because it scars their mind for life. If Islam's only way to make the children moral is to psychologically damage them, you're yourself morally bankrupt.

## Refutation
That take is colder than a banana dipped in liquid nitrogen, because teaching children about a cage full of criminals in which they'll suffer together for an extended period of time if they commit a crime when they reach the age of adulthood should also be categorized as child abuse. If psychologically damaging people by scaring them with the concept of imprisonment is the only motive to stop crime, then this is also moral bankruptcy, following your absurd way of thinking, or even better as an example; teaching children about the consequences of playing with fire or drinking acid should be considered child abuse, because it damages their mentality for life.

You people scare children with the consequences of smoking, drinking, taking drugs, staying the night, neglection of studies, eating sweets, being in a rush and a hurry, and find no problem with it because the incitement of terror here is "for a better tomorrow." However, if someone has to issue a reminder of Hell, the Punishment of the Grave, and the horrors of the Judgement Day, they reply with: "What are these psychological knots?"

Your problem is not with the issue of "scaring children," but the problem is with the goals and the purposes of such acts.

If you scare people for the sake of the world so that one of them becomes keen on his health, money and society, then welcome to society; take care of them and do not fail to intimidate them.

If you scare people for the sake of the afterlife so that one of them becomes keen on his religion, acts of worship, abstaining from sinning, and preparation for the post-death stage, then curses be upon you; this is where you become the barbaric, hardcore, fundamentalist, closed-minded, evil complexion!

Preservative warnings are better than unexpected punishment; Muslims send a message to their children by teaching them a concept that conforms with their level of understanding of reward and punishment.

Fear is necessary, in some cases, because it's essential to the child's survival, psychologically speaking. He must fear Allah (ﷻ) and fear committing sin. That should be a natural kind of fear, not too great or too small.

The critic here is implying that Islam's only way of moralization depends on scaring children with Hell, but is simply ignoring the other way that makes them want to go to an eternal residence of otherworldly pleasure and happiness; Paradise. Pointing out punishment and ignoring reward just to defame Islam is as hypocritical as addressing the issue to be an act solely reserved to Islam.

Humans are born monotheists; the belief in Allah (ﷻ) and the afterlife is totally natural and biologically rooted, but get subjected to corruption and amalgamation over time depending on external environments and self-imposed indoctrination. This rooted spiritual instict of pure monotheism is called, in Arabic, the "Fitrah (فطرة)."

Environments of indoctrination must be externally exposed to children, since everyone does it, both theists and atheists. If we ever leave this methodology of raising our children, they'll easily and rapidly get exposed to all sorts of falsehood; we don't want that to happen, since they aren't grown enough to grasp the concept of morality, so imposing fear makes it convenient at age.

The Fitrah of children is uncorrupted, and thus, the concept of Heaven and Hell aligns with their psychology, hence they find nothing wrong with it; you literally can't damage a child's psychology by reinforcing the dichotomy between good and evil. Children by default understand what reward and punishment are. The sense of entitlement that corrupts this psychology is due to doctrinal influences of "individualism."

By the way, specifications of torment in Hell, like eternal burning, is only to strengthen the fear and embolden its shape, hardness and resistance of external effects into something that resembles iron, however, exaggeration of specification, especially to the point where a child begins to cry, is definitely haram. The burden of proof lays completely on the critic's side so further he can proceed with slandering Islamic teachings:

In addition, religious upbringing, opposed to the critic's fantasies, is objectively conducive to human happiness, while an irreligious upbringing is not, in fact, it leads to psychological trauma and crippling depression, while increasing the chances of commiting suicide.

None of this atheistic propaganda is imposed on children, because they are born with the disposition of belief in Allah (ﷻ), Heaven and Hell. Humans are not naturally consequentialist and instrumentalist; we have a moral cosmology, where phenomena is ascribed to moral causes. Muslims have the highest life satisfaction, in addition to the lowest suicide rates. Atheists, in the other hand, have moral corruption, depression, and the highest suicide rates; atheism is a harmful ideology to humans, because it doesn't comply to their natural beliefs.

As a conclusion; I find it really absurd for someone to ignore the extreme negativity generated by watching films on the subject of crime, punishment, and horror on TV, in addition to reading mystery stories and accounts of fearsome events in the papers and journals, while lying about the logical steps to raise children and strengthen their psychological development, only because they're formulated by Islam's teachings.
